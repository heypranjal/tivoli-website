# üè® EXECUTE DATA POPULATION

Your Supabase database schema is ready! The tables exist but are empty due to RLS policies blocking anonymous inserts.

## Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/sivirxabbuldqkckjwmu
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**

## Step 2: Execute Data Population SQL

Copy and paste this SQL code into the SQL Editor and click **Run**:

```sql
-- Populate brands
INSERT INTO brands (slug, name, display_name, description, brand_color, sort_order) VALUES
('tivoli', 'Tivoli', 'The Tivoli', 'Luxury hotels offering unparalleled hospitality and elegant accommodations', '#CD9F59', 1),
('omnia', 'Omnia', 'Omnia', 'Contemporary luxury with modern amenities and sophisticated design', '#2C3E50', 2),
('upper-hse', 'Upper HSE', 'The Upper HSE', 'Premium hospitality with attention to detail and personalized service', '#8B4513', 3),
('wedcation', 'Wedcation', 'Wedcation', 'Destination wedding venues with comprehensive celebration services', '#E91E63', 4);

-- Populate locations
INSERT INTO locations (slug, name, state, display_order) VALUES
('delhi', 'Delhi', 'Delhi', 1),
('noida', 'Noida', 'Uttar Pradesh', 2),
('greater-noida', 'Greater Noida', 'Uttar Pradesh', 3),
('palwal', 'Palwal', 'Haryana', 4),
('rewari', 'Rewari', 'Haryana', 5),
('ambala', 'Ambala', 'Haryana', 6),
('israna', 'Israna', 'Haryana', 7);

('Swimming Pool', 'Indoor/outdoor swimming pool with poolside service', 'Waves', 'wellness'),
('Fitness Center', '24/7 modern fitness center with latest equipment', 'Dumbbell', 'wellness'),
('Spa Services', 'Full-service spa with therapeutic treatments', 'Heart', 'wellness'),
('Yoga Studio', 'Dedicated yoga and meditation space', 'User', 'wellness'),

-- Dining
('Multi-Cuisine Restaurant', 'Fine dining restaurant with diverse menu', 'Utensils', 'dining'),
('Room Service', '24-hour in-room dining service', 'Coffee', 'dining'),
('Bar & Lounge', 'Cocktail bar and lounge area', 'Wine', 'dining'),
('Banquet Hall', 'Grand banquet facilities for events', 'Users', 'dining'),

-- Business & Connectivity
('Free WiFi', 'Complimentary high-speed internet throughout', 'Wifi', 'business'),
('Business Center', 'Fully equipped business center', 'Briefcase', 'business'),

('Event Lawn', 'Spacious outdoor event and wedding lawn', 'MapPin', 'recreation'),
('Parking', 'Complimentary valet and self-parking', 'Car', 'recreation');
```

## Step 3: Create Storage Buckets

In the same SQL Editor, execute this to create storage buckets:

```sql
-- Create storage buckets
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES 
  ('hotel-images', 'hotel-images', true, 10485760, ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp']),
  ('hotel-videos', 'hotel-videos', true, 104857600, ARRAY['video/mp4', 'video/webm']),
  ('documents', 'documents', false, 5242880, ARRAY['application/pdf', 'application/msword']);

-- Create storage policies for hotel-images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public read access on hotel images" 
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT 
USING (bucket_id = 'hotel-images');

-- Allow anonymous uploads for migration (TEMPORARY - remove in production)
CREATE POLICY "Anonymous upload for migration" 
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT 
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'hotel-images');
```

## Step 4: Populate Hotels Data

Execute this to add the main hotel data:

```sql
-- Get brand and location IDs for reference
WITH brand_refs AS (
  SELECT id as tivoli_id FROM brands WHERE slug = 'tivoli'
), location_refs AS (
  SELECT 
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'delhi') as delhi_id,
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'noida') as noida_id,
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'palwal') as palwal_id,
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'rewari') as rewari_id,
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'greater-noida') as greater_noida_id,
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'ambala') as ambala_id,
    (SELECT id FROM locations WHERE slug = 'israna') as israna_id
)

-- Insert hotels
INSERT INTO hotels (slug, name, brand_id, location_id, description, rating, street, city, state, phone, is_featured, sort_order) 
SELECT * FROM (
  VALUES 
    ('tivoli-bijwasan', 'Tivoli Bijwasan', (SELECT tivoli_id FROM brand_refs), (SELECT delhi_id FROM location_refs), 'Luxury hotel in the heart of Delhi with modern amenities', 5.0, 'Bijwasan Road', 'Delhi', 'Delhi', '+91-11-XXXXXXXX', true, 1),
    ('tivoli-lotus-court', 'Tivoli Lotus Court', (SELECT tivoli_id FROM brand_refs), (SELECT noida_id FROM location_refs), 'Premium business hotel in Noida with elegant accommodations', 5.0, 'Sector 18', 'Noida', 'Uttar Pradesh', '+91-120-XXXXXXXX', true, 2),
    ('tivoli-royal-palace', 'Tivoli Royal Palace', (SELECT tivoli_id FROM brand_refs), (SELECT palwal_id FROM location_refs), 'Majestic palace hotel offering royal luxury', 5.0, 'Palace Road', 'Palwal', 'Haryana', '+91-1275-XXXXXXXX', true, 3),
    ('tivoli-heritage-palace', 'Tivoli Heritage Palace', (SELECT tivoli_id FROM brand_refs), (SELECT rewari_id FROM location_refs), 'Heritage hotel blending tradition with modern comfort', 5.0, 'Heritage Complex', 'Rewari', 'Haryana', '+91-1274-XXXXXXXX', true, 4),
    ('tivoli-grand-palace', 'Tivoli Grand Palace', (SELECT tivoli_id FROM brand_refs), (SELECT greater_noida_id FROM location_refs), 'Grand luxury hotel with world-class facilities', 5.0, 'Alpha Road', 'Greater Noida', 'Uttar Pradesh', '+91-120-XXXXXXXX', true, 5)
) AS t(slug, name, brand_id, location_id, description, rating, street, city, state, phone, is_featured, sort_order);
```

## Step 5: Verify Data Population

Execute this query to verify all data was inserted correctly:

```sql
-- Check data counts
SELECT 
  'brands' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM brands
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'locations' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM locations  
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'amenities' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM amenities
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'hotels' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM hotels
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'storage.buckets' as table_name, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM storage.buckets;

-- Preview data
SELECT 'BRANDS:' as section, slug, name FROM brands
UNION ALL
SELECT 'HOTELS:', slug, name FROM hotels;
```

**Status: Ready for Data Population**
‚úÖ Database schema exists  
‚úÖ Tables are empty and ready
‚úÖ SQL scripts prepared for manual execution

**After executing the SQL above:**
1. Run verification script: `npm run migrate:test`
2. Proceed with image migration to Supabase Storage
3. Test complete application with live data
